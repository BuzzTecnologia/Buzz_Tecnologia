			<h1>Want to know more about how the creative process works?</h1>
				<p>We have prepared a brief explanation so that you can be more inside, read below:</p>

				<div><br/>
				<center>
					<span>Analyze</span> <hr/>
				</center>
					<p>
						The analysis process, is the first to be carried out, 
						and has the function of understanding what the need of 
						each client is, what in fact he needs in the system, what 
						are the priorities, who will access it, among other information, 
						that they are raised through an interview with the client, or through
						group questionnaires. <br/>
						At the end of this step, we perform a graphic representation of the desired 
						system (a diagram), so that we can identify and visualize the flow and 
						storage of information that the system will work on.

					<span>Database</span><hr/>
				</center>
					<p>
						But, after all, what is a database for? <br/>
						The database is the place where the information is stored, 
						and it is from there that the system "pulls" the data when 
						we request it. <br/>
						When you schedule an appointment, the attendant requests some 
						data such as name, date of birth, telephone, so that your registration 
						can be carried out, all this information is stored in your system. 
						On the scheduled day, just giving your name and time, the attendant
						already has your data "saved" in the system, even if they were informed on 
						another day ... This is the database.

				<div><br/>
				
				<center>
					<span>Front-end</span> <hr/>
				</center>
					<p>
						As the name itself says, the front end refers to the front, what the system user will see. That is, this part 
						of the system is where we will define the colors that will be used, the buttons, images, 
						format of all the items present, everything that is visible, according to the request of each customer.
					</p>
				</div>

			<div class="cartao">
				<img src="../img/back.jpg"/>
				<div><br/>
				<center>
					<span>Back-end</span> <hr/>
				</center>
					<p>
						In the back-end is where the "magic" happens, as it is responsible for bringing function, to what is visible. 
						For example, when you click on a button and it sends a message or directs you to a page, that function has been programmed. 
						This programming happens through codes that "tell" what the system should do when you click on a certain button.
