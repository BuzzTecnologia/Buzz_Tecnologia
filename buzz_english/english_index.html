					<h1>Analyze</h1>
					<p>
						The analysis process, is the first to be carried out, as soon as our client seeks us for the realization of a system,
						be it internal or virtual. <br/> The analysis has the function of understanding what each customer needs, what he actually needs
						that is inserted, what are the priorities, who will access it, among other information that are raised through an interview with the client,
						or through group questionnaires. In fact, there are several methods to carry out this survey, however, the "interview" is one of the methods
						most used nowadays. <br/> After this stage, we started more specific studies, and made some drawings, which we call a diagram,
						so that we can get closer and closer to a system, because that way we can identify the flow that will actually happen.

					<h1>Database</h1>
					<p>
						Even when we are not aware of how systems work, it is very common to hear someone talk about the famous database, but what is it and what is it for? <br/>
						The database is the place where the information is stored, and it is from there that the system "pulls" the data when we request it. I'll give you an example to clarify better ... <br/> Imagine that you
						call a medical clinic to schedule an appointment, and an attendant requests some of your data such as name, date of birth, telephone, among other things so that your registration can be carried out
						and then when you arrive on the scheduled day, just informing your name and time, the attendant already has your data "saved" there even if they were informed on another day ...
						This is the database, incredible right? That is why this analysis of the bank is also necessary, so that we can know which data will be stored and which can be discarded.

					<h1>Front-end</h1>
					<p>
						As the name itself says, the front end refers to the front, what the system user will see. That is, this part 
						of the system is where we will define the colors that will be used, the buttons, images, 
						format of all the items present, everything that is visible, according to the request of each customer.
					</p>
				</div>

			<div class="cartao">
				<img src="../img/back.jpg"/>
				<div>
					<h1>Back-end</h1>
					<p>
						In the back-end is where the "magic" happens, as it is responsible for bringing function, to what is visible. 
						For example, when you click on a button and it sends a message or directs you to a page, that function has been programmed. 
						This programming happens through codes that "tell" what the system should do when you click on a certain button.
